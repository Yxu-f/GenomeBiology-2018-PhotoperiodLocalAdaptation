ABCinference.R
Script for performing Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to jointly estimate s (the strength of selection on the beneficial mutation causing the sweep) and T (the time since the beneficial allele fixed). Script modified from original provided by Ormond et al (2016) at http://jjensenlab.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/ABC_inference.zip
